# screeps-artificial-stupidity
set of functions, types, some globals, and too much if-else blocks. if used as a codebase for running your screeps game, it just might work. feeling intrigued, might update later.

i've used [screeps-typescript-starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter) for some typed fun. updated some dependencies, so far so good.
